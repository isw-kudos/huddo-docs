Personal Analytics \u00b6 All users are presented with reports about their own activity and content to allow them to analyse and understand their own usage of Connections. These reports can be accessed through the \u2018My Page\u2019 area in the Homepage application. Examples - My Most visited Blogs, My Recent Network Contact, My Recent Followers, etc. Community Level Analytics \u00b6 Community managers/owners are presented with reports that help monitor their Community\u2019s usage and adoption. These reports can be accessed through the Huddo Community Analytics widget. These reports can only be accessed and customised by the Owners of the Community. Examples \u2013 Most Popular Ideas, Number of Visits Over Time, Most Recent Members, etc. Overall (admin) Connections Analytics \u00b6 Overall Connections Reports focus on usage and adoption of the entire Connections environment. These reports are accessed in a very similar way to Community reports but they are only available within the \u2018Huddo Analytics\u2019 community as defined in the widgets-config.xml file during installation. Please see the Installation guide for more details. Examples - Most Active Users, Most Active Content, Percentage of Users Active in BUILDING, Connections Usage by Application, etc. Categories of Reports \u00b6 Huddo Analytics includes over 100 pre-defined graphs and data reports to help monitor user-adoption and usage within Connections. In addition, further reports can be created by Connections Administrators and Community Managers using the Custom Report templates. Most reports are organised into the five main categories as listed below. Connections - Reports in this category provide an overview of user activity within Connections e.g. Number of Visit Events Over Time, Number of Create Events by Application Demographics - These Reports are based on user groups defined by Profile attributes e.g. _Connections Usage by Country, Connections Usage by Building, Percentage of Users Active in Each Building Content Content Reports provide an insight into the different types of content as well as content with specific attributes within Connections e.g. Most Created Types of Content, Most Followed Content, Most Visited Content User - These Reports \u2013 are aimed at enabling the viewer to identify users based on their usage of Connections e.g. Inactive Users, Users Ranked by Number of Visits, Most Active Users Community Community reports help identify communities based on usage and adoption related attributes such as size, contributions e.g. Largest Communities, Most Active Communities usage There is also a Huddo report category for Huddo Badges/Thanks/Awards. Huddo Huddo reports help quantify Badges/Thanks/Awards received on Badge and User e.g. Total Awarded Badges, Thanks Awarded usage, Huddo Summary Report Default Available Reports \u00b6 Below is a full list of all reports provided as part of Huddo Analytics, organised by Report Access Level and Category .

Huddo Badges for Connections is a flexible gamification engine for Connections. By providing achievements and rewards (Huddo Badges), rank and leaderboards (Huddo Rank), and missions (Huddo Missions), organisations can dramatically improve their user engagement and adoption of Connections. In addition, Huddo Badges is an extensible platform that can leverage game theory to provide performance management mechanics and reward systems for applications outside of Connections such as HR, Sales Force Management, Help Desks, and many more. Huddo also now includes a peer to peer and team recognition feature; Huddo Thanks. Huddo Points \u00b6 Huddo Points are awarded to people for performing certain actions. For example you get a Huddo Point for posting a status update or making a comment. You get 5 Huddo Points for creating a blog, or 3 Huddo Points for having one of your files recommended by another person. You can even be awarded Huddo Points for achieving a particular badge or for completing a Huddo Mission or category of badges. The value of any particular action or reward can be configured so the points system can be tweaked to meet your needs. You can also be awarded Huddo Points for your actions outside of Connections helping to drive your organisations\u2019 performance management. Huddo Metrics \u00b6 Metrics are at the heart of Huddo Badges. Metrics are basically a way of awarding and tracking Huddo that determine if a particular badge, mission, or achievement has been awarded. Metrics also award Huddo that add to the person\u2019s Huddo Rank and their leaderboard position. Metrics are SQL statements that analyse information in your database. You can even define Metrics that count other Metrics! We provide many out of the box metrics for Connections that you can add to or modify. In addition you can also build your own custom metrics that capture actions and performance from external applications. You can then reward users based on their actions and behaviour outside of Connections. Huddo Filters \u00b6 Filters work alongside Metrics. Filters are also SQL statements, and they are applied to Metrics to, as the name suggests, filter the selected users using contextual parameters such as Time, Community, Name etc. For example, to select a user with the display name Joe Bloggs, we can use the Profile Like Metric with the filter Display Name Like with its parameter set to \u2018Joe Bloggs \u2019 . Like Metrics, we also provide many out of the box filters for Connections that you can modify or add to, and you can build your own custom filters for use with external applications. Huddo Badges \u00b6 Huddo Badges are rewards that users receive for performing certain actions. There are simple badges that are fairly easy to achieve and more complex badges that require significant effort. The Huddo Badges are designed to not only reward users but to also encourage progression and exploration of other features. Badges are grouped into categories and missions and are achieved by meeting the required metrics for each badge. Badges are defined by selecting pre-configured Metrics, and specifying the upper and lower limits of the Huddo points returned by these Metrics, required to achieve that Badge. You can make Badges as simple or as complex as you wish by varying the amount of Metrics you are counting. Huddo Awards \u00b6 Huddo Awards is a reward and recognition system which provides the capability of directly awarding Badges to one or more users. Huddo provides a set of default Awards to reward loyalty, efficiency, expertise, etc. The default Awards have been designed to be generic and universally applicable, however they can be customised and/or replaced with ones more applicable to your environment. Huddo Leaderboard \u00b6 The Huddo Badges Leaderboard enables users to view the top 10 contributors throughout Connections. You can filter the leaders to just people from your network, everyone, or even Community members (when viewing the Huddo Leaderboard in a Community). You can also view a break-down of which categories the Points/Badges came from by simply selecting the user in the Leaderboard. Huddo Configurators \u00b6 The Huddo Badges, Metrics & Filters Configurators allow the user to control and customise Badges, Metrics & Filters. These Configurators are designed for use by Administrators, and not general users. As such controlling access to them is very important. Therefore we have built them to only operate in one specific Connections Community, which you can control. This means that the Community Administrators use the Members list to specify the users allowed access to each Configurator. We will be creating three Communities; one for each Configurator. These Communities can be Stand-alone Communities or Sub-Communities of existing Communities if you wish. Huddo Badges Summary \u00b6 The Huddo Summary Widget is added to everyone's profile so that others can see what achievements and rewards the person has received. When you mouse over each badge it provides you with details on why the badge was awarded and tasks that you can consider to try and win another badge! The idea is to not only reward people for their behaviour but to also provide them with guidance and education on what else they can do in Connections. When users click on the View All link it takes them to their Huddo Badges Progress and Detail Page. Huddo Profile Progress Widget \u00b6 Encourage the users to get started in Connections! The Profile Progress Widget displays a progress bar indicating a Profile\u2019s maturity level and gives users ideas to improve it based on what the Profile is lacking. This widget uses existing metrics to measure in real-time the level of completion of a Profile. What makes this feature really powerful is that it is completely configurable allowing you to fine tune it to your environment! Huddo Thanks \u00b6 There is nothing quite as simple as saying \"Thank You\" to provide some recognition of great work. Think about it for a moment...when somebody thanks you for your great idea, or for putting in that extra work to meet a deadline, or maybe for just being a good team mate, it makes you feel great and more motivated to stay engaged. That is why ISW has developed Huddo Thanks, the peer to peer and team recognition tool for Connections. Motivate your team We all do performance reviews (or we all should!), however often the problem is that the various achievements or small goals we meet throughout the year can be easily forgotten. Why wait for the next big meeting to provide some feedback to your team. Huddo Thanks enables you to provide real time feedback and to publically acknowledge great work quickly and easily. The recognition then stays visible on the person's profile so that peers and colleagues can see and recognise the value that is placed on a person\u2019s work. Peer to Peer recognition Thanks don\u2019t always come from your boss either! Often having your direct peers\u2019 thank you for some great work can be a great motivator. With Huddo Thanks users of Connections can select from a range of Thanks related badges, choose who to award the thanks to, add a message and send it off! The thanks will appear on the users profile as well as integrate within their Activity Steam so that others can see as well. Management or Team recognition Huddo also allows for Manager or Team Leader Thanks Badges. You can create your own special badges that only certain people can award such as employee of the month. And because Huddo Thanks is built to be social, within Connections peers and colleagues are able to see and add value to the recognition and thanks as well! Thanks Badges Select from provided badges or create your own. You can even set how often a Thanks badge may be awarded to add more value. Personalised Messages & Reputation You can provide a personal message of recognition when awarding a thanks badge. Thanks Received and Given remain on your profile so the recognition you receive is not forgotten. Thanks Allowance Control how often a Thanks badge may be awarded to add more value and create a greater impact. Social Recognition & Notifications Thanks given to users are published in the Discover Feed for everyone to see. An email notification is sent to the user as well to make sure they receive your thanks. Huddo Groups \u00b6 Huddo Groups allows administrators to group users. These groups can then be used to control access to various parts of Huddo. For example in Thanks Badges, allowing you to define Thanks which can only be awarded by selected users. This allows you to define exclusive Management badges such as \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d which can only be awarded by those you choose! You can also use Groups to exclude users from appearing in the Leaderboards! Connections Activity Stream Integration \u00b6 Huddo now includes Embedded Experiences in the Activity Stream through use of the new Open Social Gadget standards. Now you can enjoy a richer Huddo experience, through the ability to Comment & Like on Awarded Badges and Thanks. Awarded Badges All awarded badges will now appear on the Discovery tab in the Activity Stream. Further details about the Badge can be viewed by opening the Embedded Huddo Gadget. Huddo News Gadget From the Huddo News Gadget users can now Like and Comment on Huddo Activity Stream Entries. Liking Huddo Entries When a User Likes the item, a new entry describing the Liking of the Content, is created in the Activity Stream and the original entry is rolled up into the new entry. If the user chooses to Undo this Like, then this new Stream Entry is removed and the previous Entry takes its place again. Commenting on Huddo Entries When a User Comments on the item, a new entry describing the Comment on the Content, is created in the Activity Stream and any previous entries are rolled up into the new entry. If the user chooses to remove this Comment, then the new Stream Entry is removed and the previous Entry takes its place again. Users can also edit their own comments after posting to correct any mistakes quickly and easily. Recent Updates All activity performed on the Stream Entries can be viewed on the Recent Updates tab of the Huddo News Gadget. This includes the creation of the original entry as well as all comments and likes on the entry. This allows you to see who responded and when. To make things even simpler, all timestamps are updated in real time, so you are never misinformed! Thanks Given All Thanks given by users will now appear in the Discovery tab in the Activity Stream. Further details about the Thanks, including the personal message of recognition, can be seen by opening the Embedded Huddo News Gadget. Thanks Email Notifications Users receiving Thanks will also be notified by email. Details about the Thanks, including the personal message of recognition, are included in this email.","title":"Details"},{"location":"badges/#huddo-points","text":"Huddo Points are awarded to people for performing certain actions.

It is a powerful addition to any business, whether you're looking to increase your personal productivity, super charge your teams', or collaborate with external parties. Learn quick tips and tricks from our help guides to get the most out of boards. Let's get started! Here are some quick instructions to help you get started with Huddo Boards. Create A Board \u00b6 From the My Boards homepage, click on the New Board button, or use the + buttons as indicated below. Enter a name and description for your new board. Don't worry you can edit these later. Select any users or groups you would like to add to your board. Also select if you would like to share this board with the rest of your team. These settings can be changed after a board has been created as well. Select from our range of quick templates; Search the template library for a more sophisticated template; Or Select Blank to choose your own adventure! Select the starting view for your board from the three available options: Kanban , Mindmap and Timeline . Note that the view of the board can be switched at any point in time. Click Create The board is now ready to use! Kanban View - Add Lists and Cards \u00b6 Add lists to a board to categorise todos and entries. Click on Add a list to add a new list to your board. Click on Add a card in any list to add a card to that list. Add cards to your lists to represent Tasks, Work Items, Decisions, Ideas, Notes, Options, Sub-lists - Really anything you need them to represent. The beauty of this design is that you can use lists and cards to mean anything you need to for the task at hand. Assign Tasks To Others \u00b6 Assign Tasks to people in the board by either dragging their photo from the members panel in the right side bar. Or use the Assign Users control from the card details view. When you assign a card to a person, they are notified of the assignment via email and also via any news feeds that board has access to (Workspace chat, Connections activity stream, etc.). Plan Your Tasks \u00b6 Boards lets you assign due dates to a card, as well as start and end dates, to help you better plan your tasks. Go to the Timeline View in a board to view the cards according to their start and end dates. To modify the start/end/duration of a card, simply drag the card to a new date, or drag the edges to individually change the start or end date. View Card Details \u00b6 Click on a card to open it. The card details popup gives you access to a whole range of information and controls for the card. It lets you view and edit the card's name, completion status, description, tags, attachments, comments, due date, colour labels, fields and much more! Edit Board Options \u00b6 Click on the Edit icon on the top right of the board to open the Board details view. This view lets you edit the board's name, description, tags, due date and more. It also let's you create a templates and archive the board. Add and Remove Board Members \u00b6 Click on Members in the right sidebar to open the Board Members view. You can view all the orgs, individuals and groups who have access to this board. If you have Owner role for the board, you can also add and remove members from this view. It is also possible to invite a user to the board using their email address. Colour Code Your Cards \u00b6 Huddo Boards allows you to colour code your tasks by simply dragging and dropping the colours from the right sidebar onto cards. You can also assign custom text labels to each of the colours by simply clicking the edit icon in the Colour Labels section in the right sidebar. These labels are set at the board level and everyone in the board will see the same labels. Colour Code Your Boards \u00b6 Huddo Boards let's you colour code all your boards to help you personally manage and categorise your work. To colour code a board tile in the My Boards view, simply drag a colour from the left sidebar and drop it on a board. Much like card colour labels, you can also add custom text labels to these colours, however, this is for your personal organisation and as such will only be visible to you. To edit the board colour labels, click the edit icon in the Tile Colours section in the left sidebar.

Timeline \u00b6 Timeline view is the best way to visually observe dependencies as arrows drawn between scheduled tasks. There are several options available for showing dependency arrows in the timeline view, controlled by settings in the right hand sidebar: Show all dependency arrows \u00b6 This is the default setting and will show all dependencies as blue arrows at all times. The arrows will recalculate themselves if tasks are moved or resized, or if dependencies are added or removed. Hide dependency arrows \u00b6 Use this option to hide all dependency arrows in Timeline. Hovering on a task to show its dependency chain can still be achieved when arrows are hidden, depending on the setting below. Hover on a task to highlight its dependency chain \u00b6 Hover anywhere for a few moments on a task/card that has dependencies to highlight dependent tasks and also visualise the chain of dependency links as arrows to and from the dependant cards. Note that numbers also appear in the top right of the highlighted cards to indicate the order that they need to be completed. When Hover on a task to highlight its dependency chain is enabled, the arrow display depth slider will be shown, and can be used to increase the number of \"levels\" (backwards and forwards from the hovered card) to show a chain of dependency link arrows in the Timeline view, originating from the card that is being hovered on. See the animation below as an example of 2 levels of dependency depth.

How to use the Timeline \u00b6 Whether you\u2019re starting a new board, or using an existing board, for cards to appear on the timeline, they\u2019ll need to have a start and finish date. From the Timeline view, these dates can be added in two ways: Drag and Drop Unscheduled Cards If you have cards that are sitting in the Unscheduled Cards area on the bottom right-hand side, you can drag and drop them on to the timeline. To begin, cards can only be dropped in to the list they have been created in and will by default, be allocated to three days from start to finish. Once you\u2019ve dropped a card in to its list, you can move it along the timeline in either direction, shorten or lengthen its start and finish dates, or move to a different list. Add Start and Finish Dates to a Card Cards sitting in the Unscheduled Cards area can be clicked on to bring up the detailed card view. From here, select Set Dates , from the right-hand side menu. Add in a start and finish date under the card title for it to appear on the Timeline. The finish date will automatically fill to three days after start date, but this can be edited. Note: In the Kanban Board view or Mind Map view, you also have the option to add dates to cards, by clicking in to the detailed card view, selecting Set Dates, and adding a Start Date and End Date.

Rationale \u00b6 There's a fair chance of files in different CCM libraries and/or folders having the same file name. CCM files exported to the OS file system are therefore placed in separate directories if they came from different libraries and/or folders, to minimise the chance of filename conflicts. The export process must create additional files to record metadata which isn't contained in the CCM files themselves. Examples of metadata are tags, comments, names of file owners, and create/update timestamps. Other files are also required for versions. Metadata and version files must all be named in a way that unambiguously identifies the files to which they relate, but there's a chance that any of these extra files could conflict with other filenames from the same CCM folder. We create a separate file-system directory for each CCM file to contain metadata related to that file, with the directory name having \".meta\" appended to the filename, and we also put all metadata directories and files in a top-level directory separate to the current-version files. This removes any chance of metadata filenames conflicting with CCM filenames, and the \".meta\" suffix on the directory name should minimise the chance of a directory-name conflict. Directory structure \u00b6 When migrating to the file system, all folders in a library and the current version of all files are placed in a directory structure like the following: <Community Name>/files/<Library Name>/<Folder>/<Subfolder> When either migrating to the file system, or exporting metadata during a migration to Connections Files, metadata files and folders will be placed in a directory structure like the following: <Community Name>/metadata/<Library Name>/<Folder>/<Subfolder> The metadata location is also used to export most file versions excluding the current version, when migrating to the file system. In both cases above, <Subfolder> may be repeated for as many subfolder levels as were present in CCM. Within the metadata structure, there will be: A members.csv file in each library directory, listing the library members; members.csv and meta.csv files for each folder, listing the folder members and metadata; and Directories named like <Filename><extension>.meta corresponding with each CCM file. This directory will contain versions of the CCM file, along with comments.csv , members.csv , and meta.csv files listing comments, members, and metadata for that file. Versions of a CCM file have version numbers in their filename. Version numbers will be exactly as reported by CCM, which typically uses a major/minor decimal format like \" 1.0 \". The filename format for versions will be: <Original filename>_v<version number><extension> Example: \u00b6 If the current version is Proposal.docx , then version 1 (superseded) will be Proposal_v1.0.docx in the Proposal.docx.meta subdirectory. User access \u00b6 Files named members.csv list members (user access) for each community, library, folder, and file. These files will be formatted as comma-separated values with one record (user/group) per line, with five fields per record. The fields will be: User/group name; Unique user id; User email address; Type (either \"user\" or \"group\"); and Access level (one of \"member\" or \"owner\" for communities, or one of \"owner\", \"contributor\", \"editor\", or \"reader\" for libraries, folders, and files). The users/groups listed in members.csv will be those with explicit access, plus some special user names as follows: \"*Community Access*\", indicating the community access setting (one of \"public\", \"moderated\", or \"restricted\"); \"*Community Members*\", indicating the access that community members have to a library, folder, or file. \"*Community Owners*\", indicating the access that community owners have to a library, folder, or file. Comments, tags, and other metadata \u00b6 The metadata directory for each CCM file (directory name ending with \".meta\") contains files named comments.csv and meta.csv . Directories representing CCM folders within the metadata structure will also contain a meta.csv file. comments.csv contains all comments for the file. Comma-separated fields for each comment are: File version on which the comment was made. Date/time, formatted as ISO 8601 in UTC (e.g. \"2021-02-26T09:00:00.000Z\"); Commenter user name; Commenter unique user id; Commenter email address; and The comment text. meta.csv contains any metadata which isn't comments or members. Comma-separated fields for each line are: The type of metadata, one of: \"uuid\" - CCM file/folder uuid; \"comm_uuid\" - Source community uuid; \"componentId\" - CCM component id (appears in CCM URLs); \"name\" - CCM file/folder name; \"renamed\" - Migrated file/folder name (always present even if the name wasn't changed); \"created\" - Creation date/time, formatted as ISO 8601 in UTC; \"author\" - Display name of author/creator; \"modified\" - Last-modified date/time, formatted as ISO 8601 in UTC; \"modifier\" - Display name of user who last modified the file/folder; \"summary\" - File description/summary; \"tag\" - File tags (this metadata type is repeated if there are multiple tags); \"draft\" - Has the value \"true\" if the current version is a draft, but is otherwise absent; \"likes\" - Number of likes; \"downloads\" - Number of downloads; \"link\" - CCM file/folder URL as reported by CCM API (may redirect to another URL when used in a web browser); \"link_alt\" - Alternate CCM file/folder URL; \"link_ibmscp\" - CCM file/folder URL for the ibmscp protocol (Connections Mobile); \"link_content\" - CCM file download URL; \"dest_uuid\" - Connections file/folder uuid (if migrated to Connections Files); \"dest_comm_uuid\" - Destination community uuid (if migrated to Connections Files); \"dest_link\" - Connections file/folder URL (if migrated to Connections Files); \"dest_link_content\" - Connections file download URL (if migrated to Connections Files); \"doc_type\" - CCM document type display name; \"doc_type_uuid\" - CCM document type uuid; Custom fields - Any metadata types different from those above are custom fields defined as part of the CCM document type. The version number to which the metadata applies. This will be blank for the current version; and The metadata value. General information - CSV files \u00b6 CSV files created by CCM Migrator conform to Microsoft Excel's CSV format, with details as follows: Fields are separated by commas. Text data is contained in double-quote characters. Text data can contain commas without any type of \"escape character\", because the enclosing double-quotes ensure those commas aren't interpreted as separators. Literal double-quote characters can be included in text data by doubling them. I.e. The double-quote character acts as an \"escape character\" for itself. Text data can contain literal line breaks, therefore any single record can use multiple lines. This is unlikely to occur in this application, but may be possible with metadata.","title":"File-system Export"},{"location":"ccm-migrator/export-fs/#file-system-export-structure","text":"This document describes the file structure used when either migrating to the file system, or exporting metadata during migration to Connections Files.","title":"File-system export structure"},{"location":"ccm-migrator/export-fs/#rationale","text":"There's a fair chance of files in different CCM libraries and/or folders having the same file name.

Gathering required information \u00b6 Before starting installation, it's required to know the \"JNDI name\" for a JDBC data source for the Filenet Object Store database. If you already know this, proceed to Installing the Application for the first time , otherwise review the following. In the ISC, navigate to Resources \\ JDBC \\ Data sources. Determine which data source relates to the Filenet Object Store database, and note the JNDI name for that data source. The image below shows an example where the data source name and JNDI name are \"FNOSDS\", but it may be different in your environment. If you're not sure which is the correct data source, check the details of each data source as follows: Click a data source name in the data source table. Check the \"Common and required data source properties\" for the data source. The correct data source should have the database name \"FNOS\", and a server name matching your Filenet / CCM database server. Once you find this data source, note the JNDI name, and you can then proceed with installation. If you can't determine the correct JNDI name, the only impact is that CCM Migrator will be unable to migrate file follows, but the installation process requires a JNDI name to be entered regardless. Installing the Application for the first time \u00b6 In the ISC, navigate to Applications \\ Application Types \\ WebSphere enterprise applications and click \"Install\". Locate the \"isw-connections-ccm.ear\" file on your local file system and click \"Next\". Select \"Fast Path\" and click \"Next\". Step 1: Leave the default values, update the Application Name if required, and click \"Next\". Step 2: Map the module to a single application server or cluster, and at least one web server, then click \"Next\". Our example uses \"UtilCluster\" and \"WebServer1\", but these names may be different in your environment. Note that after installation and before first use, the application requires users to specify a server file-system location for storing log files. If the application is mapped to a cluster, it's best if the cluster only has one server or the file-system location is synchronized between all servers in the cluster, to ensure that the log files are up to date regardless of which server the application runs on. Step 3: Enter the JNDI name for the Filenet Object Store database, which you should have obtained as described under Gathering required information . Step 4: Leave the default values and click \"Next\". Step 5: Check summary and Complete installation. Save the master configuration once complete. Updating the Web Server Plug-in \u00b6 The procedure in this section may or may not be required depending on the configuration of your Connections environment. In the ISC, navigate to Servers \\ Server types \\ Web servers. Select the web server, and click \"Generate Plug-in\".

API Settings \u00b6 On first use, the application loads on its \"API Settings\" page, and requires settings to be confirmed before it can be used. Most settings have sensible defaults, but some may need to be changed depending on your environment and on how you intend to use the application. Particularly note: \"Migration Path\" has no default and must be set before first use. \"Logs and Temporary File Path\" defaults to a subdirectory of the server's temporary files location (typically \"/tmp\" on Linux), but you may want to change this. As stated in the Installation document, this location should be synchronized between servers if the application runs on multiple servers in a cluster. \"Source Domain\" and \"Destination Domain\" must specify the protocol and domain of the Connections environments you're migrating from and to. These default to the domain where the app is installed, which will probably be correct if migrating within a single Connections environment, but you'll need to change at least one of these if migrating between two different environments. \"Destination Domain\" isn't used and is hidden if migrating to the OS file system. \"Source Auth Alias\" and \"Destination Auth Alias\" must be the names of J2C authentication aliases defined in the WebSphere ISC (under Security \\ Global Security \\ J2C authentication data) for your source and destination Connections domains. The aliases must contain credentials for a user with administrative access to Connections, because the app uses these credentials to authenticate with APIs and read/write content. \"Destination Auth Alias\" isn't used and is hidden if migrating to the OS file system. \"Output File Path\" should be a server file-system location where you want content and metadata exported. If migrating to the OS file system, all content and metadata is exported to this location. If migrating to Connections Files, metadata is exported to this location only if the migration setting to export metadata is enabled. Other API Settings are described below, but should never need to be changed for normal operation: \"Number of Threads when building list of folders and files\" - Use with caution - Can cause server CPU starvation and crashes. The value 1 means that all server-side operations run in a single thread, while higher values (up to a maximum of 4) cause more threads to be used. Higher values should improve performance if all the following conditions are met, but may otherwise cause problems: Application servers on which this application runs, along with CCM and database servers from which content will be read, have at least as many CPU threads as specified. Network connections between servers can handle the additional traffic. \"HTTP Engine Settings\": \"HTTP Request Handler\" - The default value of \"Apache HttpClient\" should always be best. The \"JVM default\" option is retained for testing because older versions of CCM Migrator had no other option. \"Maximum time to wait for data\" - HTTP read timeout in milliseconds. The default of -1 means to use an OS-dependent value which we understand to be 1 minute on many platforms. The default should be sufficient, but set it to either 0 (no timeout) or a value higher than 60000 if you observe timeouts occurring. \"Number of times to attempt each HTTP request\" - If set higher than 1 and a server-side HTTP request fails for a temporary reason (e.g. timeout or internal server error), the request will be attempted up to this many times. This setting exists because we observed seemingly-random HTTP request failures in one customer environment, but retries didn't help in that case. \"Delay before retrying failed HTTP request\" - Wait about this many milliseconds before retrying failed HTTP requests. Only has an effect if a HTTP request fails and the previous setting is 2 or higher. \"Log Settings\": \"Show username in server JVM logs\" - Makes messages written by CCM Migrator to the server's \"SystemOut.log\" and \"SystemErr.log\" files include the username of the user running Analysis, Migration, or Roll-back. The username is always recorded in CCM Migrator's application log files regardless of this setting. \"Other Settings\": \"Write XML to file system for CCM library entries\" - If enabled, raw XML representing \"feeds\" of CCM library entries will be written to the configured temporary files location. This setting exists only for debugging. Once the settings are confirmed by clicking \"Confirm Settings\" at the bottom of the page, the \"Home\" page will load. The application saves all settings in the web browser's local storage, so it will remember settings and will load the \"Home\" page by default on all subsequent use in the same browser, unless local storage is cleared. Analysis and Migration \u00b6 On first use before migrating, it's necessary to perform an analysis to build a list of communities. Click \"Analyze Communities\" to do this. By default, analysis retrieves the following information for each community: Community title; Whether the community has any CCM Libraries; Whether the community has a Files app (which is the migration target unless migrating to file system); The total size of all files in the Files app; and The quota and quota usage of the Files app; With this default behaviour, analysis running time is proportional to the number of communities in your environment. As a rough guide to performance, analysis in an ISW test environment with 270 communities takes about 20 seconds. The left-hand pane of the \"Home\" page contains several options under the heading \"Migration Settings\". Most of these options only apply to migration, but the option \"Analysis reads library size\" applies to analysis and causes it to also retrieve and display the total size of CCM Libraries in each community. Note this is very slow as it's greatly affected by the number of folders and files in all CCM Libraries. For example in the ISW test environment where analysis takes 20 seconds without this option, it takes about 5 minutes with this option, for a total of about 8000 files. Once analysis is complete, the list of Communities will be displayed. This includes filtering that defaults to show only Communities valid for migration from CCM to Files. At this point, you can migrate any number of communities by checking the box next to each Community name and clicking \"Migrate Communities\", but you should first review the \"Migration Settings\" in the left-hand pane. The settings are: \"Test Mode\" - Enabled by default. Performing migration with this enabled means that nothing is really migrated, but the migration process will retrieve and display a list of all folders and files in the selected communities. Note that a licence key is required to disable test mode and perform a real migration, and the licence key (if provided to you) must be installed as described in the Installation document. \"Per-library migration\" - If enabled, the communities table allows expanding each community to show libraries in the community, choosing individual libraries to migrate (instead of migrating all libraries in each community), and migrating libraries to subcommunities instead of to the community. \"Include Tags\" - Whether or not to migrate file tags. \"Include Comments\" - Whether or not to migrate file comments. \"Include Likes\" - Whether or not to migrate file likes. \"Include Follows\" - Whether or not to migrate file follows. \"Include Drafts\" - Whether or not to migrate draft files. Note that the Connections Files app doesn't allow drafts, so drafts from CCM will become the latest file version when migrated. \"Include Versions\" - Whether or not to migrate file versions. When enabled, you will also see an option to specify how many versions are migrated. \"Rename Conflicting Files\" - If enabled, and the Files app in a community already has files matching the name of files being migrated, the migrated files will be renamed by appending the specified \"Filename-Number Separator\" followed by a number. If disabled, files with a conflicting name won't be migrated. If a migrated folder matches the name of an existing folder in the File app, this option doesn't apply. The migration simply uses the existing folder. \"Replacement for Invalid Characters\" - If CCM folder or file names contain characters which aren't permitted in the Connections Files app, those characters are replaced by the specified replacement character. \"Migrate libraries to folders\" - Whether to migrate every library to a separate folder in the target community, regardless of how many libraries exist in the community. By default, CCM Migrator will only create a separate folder for each library if the community has two or more libraries. \"Export metadata to file-system\" - Whether to export extra metadata to the server file-system when migrating to Connections Files. The metadata includes CCM document types and custom fields, which can't be migrated to Connections Files, and is created in the \"Output File Path\" specified in API Settings. Click here for details of the export file structure. The \"Status Log\" provides details while processing. For each community, it lists all Library files (including what folder they belong to) and existing folders in the Files app during an information-gathering phase, then (if Test Mode is disabled) performs the actual migration, listing all files again with an icon and text indicating whether each file was migrated. This log persists after migration, but is cleared if either an analysis is performed or the application is restarted on the server. Once a Migration run has completed, an entry for each migrated community is added to the \"History\" page of the application, showing the community title and migration status. A file containing the history is saved under the \"Temporary Files Storage\" location on the server, and persists unless deleted by some means outside the application. Regarding file name conflicts \u00b6 When migrating files, the application makes some attempt to work around file name conflicts. This is particularly worth noting when either: One CCM library has files of the same name in different folders; or One community has two or more CCM libraries with files of the same name. HCL Connections Files permits files of the same name in different folders, but doesn't permit a top-level file (not in any folders) to have the same name as a file in a folder. By default, if CCM Migrator tries to migrate a file and finds that there is already a file of that name in Community Files, it will rename the new migrated file by appending an underscore (_) followed by a number. It will use the number 2 for the first renamed file, increasing the number if the first rename also produces a conflict, and will try up to 20 renames on each conflicting file before giving up. For example, if the file name \"My Document.doc\" conflicts with an existing Community File, it will be renamed to \"My Document_2.doc\". Additionally, for each community, the application checks whether a migration was previously attempted for that community, and avoids repeatedly migrating files which were previously migrated. This means that if a migration of one community was partially successful, but some error prevented completion, the error can be fixed and the migration repeated without having to clear out previously migrated files or producing duplicates. Important: Migrations performed before this functionality was added to CCM Migrator (on 11 Feb 2019) will not be detected, due to the reliance on a new style of system logging. The application's user-interface provides options to change the above behaviour, and those options are listed earlier in this document. Roll-back \u00b6 As of 5 April 2022, CCM Migrator has the ability to roll back migrated communities. Roll-back is only supported when migrating to Connections Files. A file-system migration can be rolled back manually by deleting the export from the server file system. Perform a roll-back by selecting desired communities and clicking the \"Roll-back Communities\" button. This will only work for communities which were previously migrated. If Test Mode is enabled, nothing will be rolled back, and the Status Log will just report the number of files and folders which can be rolled back. Roll-back only removes files and folders created by migration, and won't remove folders which still contain files or subfolders when the roll-back is otherwise complete. Roll-back also only works for communities which were migrated after the roll-back functionality was implemented, because it depends on additional data stored in the migration logs on the server. If necessary to roll back an older migration then, as long as the migrated files and folders weren't deleted or moved, simply repeat the migration. This will create a new migration log which contains the required additional data and allows roll-back.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"ccm-migrator/usage/#using-the-application","text":"The application can be accessed from your HCL Connections site using a URL like {connections domain}/isw-connections-ccm/ , where {connections domain} is the protocol and domain name of your Connections site.","title":"Using the Application"},{"location":"ccm-migrator/usage/#api-settings","text":"On first use, the application loads on its \"API Settings\" page, and requires settings to be confirmed before it can be used. Most settings have sensible defaults, but some may need to be changed depending on your environment and on how you intend to use the application. Particularly note: \"Migration Path\" has no default and must be set before first use. \"Logs and Temporary File Path\" defaults to a subdirectory of the server's temporary files location (typically \"/tmp\" on Linux), but you may want to change this. As stated in the Installation document, this location should be synchronized between servers if the application runs on multiple servers in a cluster. \"Source Domain\" and \"Destination Domain\" must specify the protocol and domain of the Connections environments you're migrating from and to. These default to the domain where the app is installed, which will probably be correct if migrating within a single Connections environment, but you'll need to change at least one of these if migrating between two different environments. \"Destination Domain\" isn't used and is hidden if migrating to the OS file system. \"Source Auth Alias\" and \"Destination Auth Alias\" must be the names of J2C authentication aliases defined in the WebSphere ISC (under Security \\ Global Security \\ J2C authentication data) for your source and destination Connections domains. The aliases must contain credentials for a user with administrative access to Connections, because the app uses these credentials to authenticate with APIs and read/write content. \"Destination Auth Alias\" isn't used and is hidden if migrating to the OS file system. \"Output File Path\" should be a server file-system location where you want content and metadata exported. If migrating to the OS file system, all content and metadata is exported to this location. If migrating to Connections Files, metadata is exported to this location only if the migration setting to export metadata is enabled. Other API Settings are described below, but should never need to be changed for normal operation: \"Number of Threads when building list of folders and files\" - Use with caution - Can cause server CPU starvation and crashes. The value 1 means that all server-side operations run in a single thread, while higher values (up to a maximum of 4) cause more threads to be used. Higher values should improve performance if all the following conditions are met, but may otherwise cause problems: Application servers on which this application runs, along with CCM and database servers from which content will be read, have at least as many CPU threads as specified. Network connections between servers can handle the additional traffic. \"HTTP Engine Settings\": \"HTTP Request Handler\" - The default value of \"Apache HttpClient\" should always be best. The \"JVM default\" option is retained for testing because older versions of CCM Migrator had no other option. \"Maximum time to wait for data\" - HTTP read timeout in milliseconds. The default of -1 means to use an OS-dependent value which we understand to be 1 minute on many platforms. The default should be sufficient, but set it to either 0 (no timeout) or a value higher than 60000 if you observe timeouts occurring. \"Number of times to attempt each HTTP request\" - If set higher than 1 and a server-side HTTP request fails for a temporary reason (e.g. timeout or internal server error), the request will be attempted up to this many times. This setting exists because we observed seemingly-random HTTP request failures in one customer environment, but retries didn't help in that case. \"Delay before retrying failed HTTP request\" - Wait about this many milliseconds before retrying failed HTTP requests. Only has an effect if a HTTP request fails and the previous setting is 2 or higher. \"Log Settings\": \"Show username in server JVM logs\" - Makes messages written by CCM Migrator to the server's \"SystemOut.log\" and \"SystemErr.log\" files include the username of the user running Analysis, Migration, or Roll-back. The username is always recorded in CCM Migrator's application log files regardless of this setting. \"Other Settings\": \"Write XML to file system for CCM library entries\" - If enabled, raw XML representing \"feeds\" of CCM library entries will be written to the configured temporary files location.
