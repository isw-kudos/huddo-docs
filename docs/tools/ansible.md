## Setup Ansible

Throughout the guides on this site we use ansible to setup servers and manage servers and deployments in both kubernetes and docker.

If you have access to a Mac or Linux machine, [follow these instructions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) to get up and running.

Whilst that document states windows is not supported, We have had success running ansible under windows by enabling WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux), installing Ubuntu from the windows store and proceeding with the Ubuntu instructions linked.

Refer to [this document from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for more information on WSL and the windows store options.
