We recommend removing all the default widgets from the main page (i.e. Forums, Bookmarks, Files and Feeds) to conserve screen real-estate, and making use of the Configurator widget easier. The default widgets may be removed or added back at any stage.

We recommend removing all the default widgets from the main page (i.e. Forums, Bookmarks, Files and Feeds) to conserve screen real-estate, and making use of the Analytics widgets easier. The default widgets may be removed or added back at any stage.

Your first Huddo Analytics widget will now be added to the main view.

The default view shows the report categories. Once a report category is selected, default report instances for that category can be selected.

Once the report instance is selected, further options for that report can be selected.

The report currently configured is previewed below the options and can be saved for quick viewing on all subsequent page loads.

In the Huddo Analytics community, the Huddo Analytics widgets provide access to Connections Administrator level reports. In other communities, the Huddo Analytics widgets can be added to provide access to Community Manager level reports.

Multiple Huddo Analytics widgets are designed to exist in each community.

### Add the User Analytics Widget to the Home page

Adding widgets to the Home page of Connections is done through the Connections Web page. 

Login to Connections as a user assigned to the admin security role of the Homepage application and navigate to the Administration tab.
