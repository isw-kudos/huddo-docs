Now that you have loaded the default metrics and badges you are ready to start awarding the badges to users. By default, Huddo Badges will start awarding badges at midnight each day. However, if you would like to start awarding badges immediately rather than waiting until the next scheduled run, you can click the Award Badges Now button.

### Award Badges Now

Login to Connections and navigate to the Badges Configurator Community

Select the Settings tab in the BadgesConfigurator widget

Click the Award Badges Now button.

**Note:** If you are installing Huddo Badges to a Connections environment for testing purposes, it is recommended that the following settings are disabled:

- _Enable Email Notifications for Badges/Awards_
- _Enable Email Notifications for Thanks_
