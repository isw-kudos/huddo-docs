# HCL Connections

Huddo Boards (Activities Plus) for HCL Connections can be deployed in one of two ways:

1.  In HCL Connections Component Pack (CP)

    !!!tip

        This is the recommended approach as the CP includes a Kubernetes environment with an existing Mongo database and S3 storage. Please follow the [Component Pack instructions](../cp/index.md) to deploy Huddo Boards.

1.  Standalone Kubernetes environment

    !!!info

        This is a more complex setup as you will need to provide/deploy your own Mongo database and S3 storage. Please follow the [Kubernetes instructions](../kubernetes/index.md) to deploy Huddo Boards.
