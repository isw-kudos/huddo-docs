# Migration of Activities to Huddo Boards (with Component Pack)

!!! tip

    If you are not using Component Pack please follow [this guide](../../connections/migration.md)

As part of the installation process for Huddo Boards (Activities Plus) you must run the migration service to move the existing Activities into Huddo Boards.

!!! info

    Please review the [Roles page](../roles/index.md) for details on how Community Activity membership is interpreted & presented by Boards

## Process Overview

This service will:

1. access Activities data in the existing Connections SQL database
1. process the Activity into a Board
1. get file attachments and long descriptions via mounting the Connections shared drive
1. write Boards data into the Component Pack mongo database
1. write file attachments into S3 storage

## Environment Variables

Ensure you have updated the following variables as applicable in your `boards-cp.yaml` file downloaded previously

#### Oracle

As of `2024-02-14` we have moved to the `node-oracledb` in `thin client` mode which does not support Native Network Encryption (NNE). Please temporarily disable NNE in the Oracle server configuration to run the migration service.

If you have this enabled, it will cause the following error:

````
Error: NJS-500: connection to the Oracle Database was broken
NJS-521: connection to host *************** port **** received end-of-file on communication channel```
````

For more information, please see the [node-oracledb documentation](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/connection_handling.html#native-network-encryption) and [this issue](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/issues/1567).

### Purge

If you encounter issues with certain Activities, you can purge them from the database re-run the migration process.

## Custom Persistent Volume

The default chart values use an NFS mount. Below are examples custom configuration of the persisent volume definition for access to the Shared Drive using other methods.

!!! note

    We recommend running the helm chart with `--dry-run --debug` to confirm the yaml output

1.  Host path

    !!! tip

        This can be used in conjunction with existing linux methods (e.g. `cifs-utils`, `smbclient` etc) to mount a Windows Samba share directly onto the Kubernetes Node(s).

    Please read the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolume).

    This migration is designed to be a once-off operation. If you are using Windows SMB shares and neither option above is appropriate for your environment, we would recommend:

    1. Temporarily copy the Activity Store content directory at `<SHARED_DRIVE>/activities/content` (e.g. `/opt/HCL/connections/data/shared/activities/content`) to an existing Linux accessible drive (e.g. `/pv-connections/activitystore`).
    1. Set the standard `sharedDrive.server` & `sharedDrive.path` to mount this path at `/data` in the containers
    1. Set `migration.env.FILE_PATH_ACTIVITIES_CONTENT_STORE: "/data"`

## Migrate Activities

You can also set the `env.IMMEDIATELY_PROCESS_ALL` if you wish to migrate every Activity without the UI.
