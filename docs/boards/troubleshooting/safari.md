## HCL Connections Community Widget

There is a limitation imposed by Apple which stops the Huddo Boards Community Widget from getting users cookies and therefore is stopping Authentication between Huddo Boards Cloud and HCL Connections.

The only solution is to disable the "Prevent cross-site tracking" option on the user's computer under Safari => Preferences => Privacy.
