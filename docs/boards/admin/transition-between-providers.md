# How To Transition between Providers
**Note: admins only - on premise**

This process is designed for migrating away from a provider but keeping access to Boards. e.g. Connections to Sharepoint Sites. Please follow the steps very carefully.

1. Backup the Boards mongo database
1. [Synchronise user profiles](sync-profiles.md)
1. [Link users accounts](link-users.md)
1. [Replace group membership](replace-group-membership.md)
1. [Transfer ownership & unlink user accounts](transfer-ownership-unlink.md)
1. [Deactivate login with original provider](deactivate-login.md)
