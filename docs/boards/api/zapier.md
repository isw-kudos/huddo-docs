# Huddo Boards Zapier Integration

!!! tip

    This feature is only available for [Huddo Boards Cloud](https://boards.huddo.com).

## What is Zapier?

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is a platform which allows end users to set up "Zaps" which are workflows that connect two or more applications (like Huddo Boards). Each Zap consists of a "Trigger" and one or more "Actions". When the trigger event occurs, Zapier automatically performs the actions.

## Huddo Boards Zaps
