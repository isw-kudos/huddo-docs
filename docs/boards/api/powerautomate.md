# Huddo Boards Power Automate Integration

!!! tip

    This feature is only available for [Huddo Boards Cloud](https://boards.huddo.com).

## What is Microsoft Power Automate?

[Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/power-platform/products/power-automate) is a platform which allows end users to set up "Flows" which are workflows that connect two or more applications (like Huddo Boards). Each Flow consists of a "Trigger" and one or more "Actions". When the trigger event occurs, Power Automate automatically performs the actions.

## Huddo Boards Connector

Huddo Boards is now available as a [connector in Microsoft Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-au/connectors/details/shared_huddoboards/huddo-boards/). Create simple or complex flows to help you work across multiple applications and save time on repeatable tasks. Have you found a flow that works for you? Share it with us and weâ€™ll turn it in to a template.
