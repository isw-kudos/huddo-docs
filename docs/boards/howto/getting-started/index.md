### Assign Tasks To Others

Assign Tasks to people in the board by either dragging their photo from the members panel in the right side bar. Or use the _Assign Users_ control from the card details view.
When you assign a card to a person, they are notified of the assignment via email and also via any news feeds that board has access to (Workspace chat, Connections activity stream, etc.).

To edit the board colour labels, click the edit icon in the _Colours_ section in the left sidebar. Filter to see boards from one or more specific colours by clicking on the colour.
