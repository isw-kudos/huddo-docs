If you find that your Microsoft Teams team `Conversations` tab is getting a bit crowded with all the updates your team are making in Huddo Boards, it is possible to control whether or not team notifications are posted in `Conversations` for each board in your team.

To do this, firstly open a board within a Teams tab.

Click the `Open Board Properties` button in the top-left corner of the board:

![Open Board Properties](/assets/msgraph/teams/open-board-options.png)

In the board properties you will see a `Disable team notifications for this board` button. (note that this may take a few seconds to appear):

Click this to disable all notifications for the board from coming up in the `Conversations` tab of your team.

Note that the notifications for the board can be enabled again by clicking the `Enable team notifications for this board` button in the same location of the board properties dialog:
