## Embedding Huddo Boards in a SharePoint Site Page

Huddo Boards' integration with Microsoft Office 365 allows you to add Huddo Boards to a SharePoint site page and work directly on the board from the page.

In the example below, we've created a site page called "Where to Eat in Melbourne" and added our Food Objectives 2019 board to it. When added, you and your colleagues can work directly from a site page on a board.

Before proceeding, you will need a site admin to enable security settings as described [here](/boards/msgraph/sharepoint_admin/)


1. From Sharepoint main menu, go to `Pages` -> `New` -> `Site Page`

1. To make a small amount of extra room on your page, you may wish to edit the title and choose `Plain` as it's layout.

1. Once you are happy with the page, click 'Publish' to make it visible to other members of your site.
