## Embedding Huddo Boards in a SharePoint Site Page

Huddo Boards' integration with Microsoft Office 365 allows you to add Huddo Boards to a SharePoint site page and work directly on the board from the page.

In the example below, we've created a site page called "Where to Eat in Melbourne" and added our Food Objectives 2019 board to it. When added, you and your colleagues can work directly from a site page on a board.
