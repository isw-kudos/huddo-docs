### Template Scheduling

When creating a Board from a template that contains dates (due, start or end dates), you have the option to adjust all of the dates by a set number of days. For example, if you have a template for preparing for a business trip, you can reschedule your template so that all of your tasks are due before your date of departure. 

On the My Boards page, click the `+ Create` button. The `New Board` window will open. Search templates by name and select your template that contains dates. 

Click `Next`. 

You'll see an option to choose a `Starts on` or `Finishes on` date. Select the one that makes sense for your template. (This won't appear if there are no dates in your template.) Use the date picker to choose which day you'd like your dates to start or finish.

You'll see a message explaining that all of the dates will be adjusted by the number of days between the date you selected and the first/last date in the template. Click `Save`. Your new Board will be created.

- If the dates in your template included Start and End dates on tasks, you can see these rescheduled items in the `Timeline` view.
- If your tasks included Due dates, you can see these rescheduled items in the `Board -> Todos by Date` view.

### Global Templates

You can access a library of global templates already available from Huddo Boards to use as inspiration for your own work.

When you start a New Board, click `Explore the Template Library`.

This will open a new window with available templates.

Feel free to click in to different templates to see what they contain. 

When you’ve found the template you’re looking for, return to your original New Board screen and start typing in the template name. It will appear and you can select it.

You still have the option to select the Starting View, from Kanban, MindMap, Timeline or Activty.

Click `Next` to give your board a name and then `Save` and you’ll be taken to your new Board.
