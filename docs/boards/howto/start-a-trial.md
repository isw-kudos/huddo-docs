#Starting a trial of Huddo Boards Cloud

The first time you sign in to Huddo Boards Cloud as an individual user, you will not have a licence to use the product.
This means you will not have the ability to create new boards. The New Board tile/button will not be functional and will appear to be greyed out. Hovering the mouse over this button will present the following tooltip message:

![example](/assets/boards/unlicensed-my-boards-view.png)

As the message states, you have the option to start a free trial on first sign in.
To start the trial, either click the `START A TRIAL` button presented at the bottom of the screen:

![example](/assets/boards/start-trial-toast.png)

Or click the user menu icon in the top right corner, then click `Start my trial`:

Once you start the trial you will have unrestricted access to use Huddo boards for the period of one month. The option to purchase a subscription to the product is also an available option by clicking `View Subscriptions` under the same user menu, as seen above.
