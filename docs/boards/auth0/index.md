This integration enables you to _manage users in Auth0_ for login to Huddo Boards. Auth0 will maintain a directory of your users for Huddo Boards. This enables standalone use of Huddo Boards if you do not have any of the other supported authentication providers in your business.

You may switch to using one of our other supported authentication providers at a later stage should you wish.
