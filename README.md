# Huddo Docs Website

This site is hosted on github pages and is generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [mkdocs-material](https://hub.docker.com/r/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/)

The static files for the website are served out from the `gh-pages` branch. They are automatically generated and committed by `mk-docs`.

A Jenkins hook automatically builds and deploys this repository on any push to the master branch. Therefore removing the need to set up local dev environments for contributing to the documentation.

## Making Changes, adding pages, etc

Directly commit any changes to the master branch to publish a new version of the website. This includes editing md files or config (in `mkdocs.yml`) and adding new pages and assets.

## Setting Up Local Dev For Previews

1. Run as Docker image

       docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material

4. Open Preview

       http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Deploying Changes Manually

1. Make sure you've previewed the changes with `mkdocs serve`
2. Make sure your local repo is up to date
3. Run this command


    mkdocs gh-deploy
